Sell stick allows players to quickly sell items inside a chest with just one click! You can **customize** almost everything! The item used, the amount of uses the item gives, as well as the name of the item and the lore! All of these options are located inside the **config.yml**!

To set the **price** for the items sold, simply edit the **prices.yml**. Alternatively, you can use your **Essentialy worth.yml** if you have that setup. Just enable that in the config.
